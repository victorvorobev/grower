# Grower

A simple (yet probably a bit complicated inside) script that prints out a tree, that look something like that:
```
                                       &|                                       
                                      & ~  &                                    
                                      &|&  &|&&                                 
                                   ~\  &&  &&&~&                                
                                   & |&|&&~&&  &                                
                                     ~&~&&      &

## Notice

This project is inspired by John Allbritten [bonsai.sh](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh).

## Requirements

Build with Python3.8. Probably won't work with earlier versions because of dataclasses and type annotations.

## Dependencies

This script requires [`sty`](https://github.com/feluxe/sty) module.

## Launch

```bash
python3 main.py
```
